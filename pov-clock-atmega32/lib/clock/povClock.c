 * Description:
 *   This file contains methods that will project the clock image and add seconds to the clock.
 *   The clock is rotating at about 1500 rpm. One rotation takes about 40ms (Â± 1.6ms). The time 
 *   for one rotation will be divided by 60. This will give us 60 steps of 666.67us. Each section
 *   of the clock image will be projected during that 666.67us timeframe.  The 666us will be 
 *   divided by 6. A section of the clock image will be projectected every 111.11us. For example, 
 *   the number 3 on the clock will be projected during the 666us window. Each slice of the number
 *   3 will be projected every 111.11us.
 *
 *   The drawClock function was measured to take about 12ms to complete. This is not including the 
 *   _delay_us() calls in the method. Using a delay of 81us for the _delay_us() calls gives us a total 
 *   delay time of (81us * 6  * 60 steps = 29.16ms). 29.16ms summed with the 12ms it takes to execute 
 *   the other lines of code in the drawClock function givs us a total rotation time of 41.16ms.
